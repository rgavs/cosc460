Report for Lab 3
----------------

Answer the questions from the lab description here.  Questions 8 and 9 do not require answers.

1. SeqScan, TupleIterator, and Operator
2. Aggregate, Delete, Filter, HashEquiJoin, Insert, Join, OrderBy, and Project.
3. Join, Project, Select
4. Without next or hasNext, Filter will simply take the super result as it extends Operator.
5. 	while(iterR.hasNext()){
		if (iterR.next().equals(predicate)){
			return iterR.next();
		}
		iterR.next();
	}
	return null;
6.	list [];
	while(iterR.hasNext()){
		t1 = iterR.next();
		while(iterS.hasNext()){
			t2 = iterS.next();
			if (t1.equals(t2)){
				t = merge(iterR.next(),iterS.next);
				list.append(t);
			}
		}
		iterS.rewind();
	}
	return list;
7. if(iterR.hasNext()){
		while(iterS.hasNext()){
			if (iterR.next().equals(iterS.next)){
				return merge(iterR.next(),iterS.next);
			}
		}
		iterS.rewind();
	}

After you complete lab 3, please answer the following questions.  

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Ryan Gavigan. Worked with Mike Dunnegan.

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I have found this to be rather challenging, though I am pleased to have Lab 2 all but finished.

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

Hardest part so far is likely within HeapPage, HeapFile or BufferPool. I have struggled with I/O.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

I have an assertion error on testCache from ScanTest.java- having difficulty debugging.

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

I have likely spent roughly two full days or more of work.
